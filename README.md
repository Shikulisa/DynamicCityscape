# DynamicCityscape
Sunset Cityscape Animation ðŸŒ‡
An aesthetically pleasing, dynamically animated cityscape that simulates a sunset transition, complete with moving buildings, a red Lamborghini-style car, and a sunset gradient inspired by realistic time-of-day color changes. This animation is built using Pygame.

Features
Dynamic Sunset Gradient: The sky transitions through vibrant colors as the sun sets.
Moving Buildings: Slow-moving buildings create an illusion of depth in the cityscape.
Animated Car: A red Lamborghini-style car moves smoothly across the scene.
Realistic Elements: Windows, roads, and symmetrical buildings enhance realism.
Demo

Include a short animated GIF or video link showing the animation in action.

Code Overview
Main Components
draw_sky() - Generates a gradient background that simulates the skyâ€™s colors at sunset.
draw_sun(y_position) - Renders a moving sun that sets gradually throughout the animation.
draw_buildings() - Creates stylized buildings with windows to give a realistic skyline appearance.
draw_car(x_position) - Displays a red Lamborghini-inspired car that moves across the screen.
Main Animation Loop - The main loop updates positions and redraws all components to create smooth animation.
Animation Details
The animation features:

Sunset Gradient: Color changes match real-world sunset aesthetics, transitioning from daylight blue to vibrant reds and purples.
Smooth Building Motion: Buildings move at the same pace as the car, giving depth to the cityscape.
Lamborghini Car: A red sports car travels horizontally and wraps around when reaching the screenâ€™s edge.
Customization
Speed Adjustments: Modify car_x and sun_y values to control the carâ€™s speed and the sunâ€™s descent rate.
Color Scheme: Change the color variables (e.g., SUNSET_SKY_TOP, SUNSET_SKY_BOTTOM) for a different atmosphere.
Building Styles: Customize the building dimensions and window pattern in draw_buildings().
